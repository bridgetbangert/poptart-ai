Many talent acquisition teams use an applicant tracking 
system (ATS) as their primary recruitment software. That 
is not “new news” to you or most other TA pros.

However, it is easy to see why many talent leaders, 
operations managers, recruiters and hiring managers 
leverage the solution to drive their talent acquisition 
strategies.

The right ATS — more specifically, one with robust 
candidate relationship management (CRM) capabilities and 
powerful talent analytics — enables talent teams to:

    Publish new postings to popular job boards with ease
    Schedule interviews with target prospects of interest
    Track all candidates as they move through the funnel
    Engage qualified candidates with personalized 
nurtures
    Manage agency-provided data and employee referrals

Hiring managers also benefit from an advanced applicant 
tracking system. Arguably the most important tasks they 
can tackle with premier, user-friendly ATS software are:

    Collaborating closely with recruiters in the 
interview process
    Keeping an eye on time to hire for each of their job 
openings
    Updating language used in poor-performing job 
descriptions
    Providing timely feedback to speed up the hiring 
process
    Helping to oversee and adjust candidate interview 
schedules

Robust ATS and CRM solutions have many benefits for 
today’s talent teams.

And yet, many job candidates are skeptical about 
applicant tracking systems.
what is an applicant tracking system
Common applicant tracking system misconceptions 
recruiters — and candidates — should know

Some candidates think ATS is a “black hole” where their 
resumes go to die (i.e., archived the second they enter a 
talent team’s database and forgotten about by 
recruiters).

Other candidates believe AI-powered applicant tracking 
systems automatically eliminate them from contention for 
roles without recruiters ever seeing their applications.

The truth is there are many falsehoods regarding the 
recruitment software — ones that prevent many job seekers 
from submitting applications from companies who host 
their job sites and career pages via popular ATS 
providers.

Here are four common misconceptions some candidates have 
around ATS (and one bonus one “myth” some talent 
acquisition pros believe about the recruiting software).
1) AI dictates which prospects talent specialists engage 
and dismiss

Artificial intelligence (AI) is now found in many ATS, in 
some form or another.

Applicant tracking systems with AI capabilities helps 
recruiters tackle key tasks, including reviewing job 
applications, résumés, and candidates’ profiles at large.

What AI doesn’t do, though, is replace the human element 
of orgs’ recruiting efforts.

Take the Fast Resume Review functionality in our unified 
talent acquisition suite:

    Recruiters with Lever use this daily to speed up all 
the assessments of prospects in their pipeline.
    Knockout questions defined by recruiters and hiring 
managers auto-eliminate prospects who don’t meet the 
bare-minimum criteria for roles (e.g., a certain number 
of years of experience or certifications).
    In minutes, they can comb over prospects’ resumes and 
answers to other application questions.
    Based on this review, they can skip, advance, or 
archive talent. This will help them save for a more 
in-depth review later, add to a nurture, or file away for 
a potential opportunity to contact later.

This evaluation is still conducted manually by those 
charged with screening talent. But Fast Resume Review 
nonetheless streamlines the task for them sans artificial 
intelligence.

“Some job seekers are leery of the ATS’s role in the 
recruiting process because it’s a barrier of entry,” said 
Lever Sr. Recruiter Rob Lingham. “They hit submit, and 
either get a positive response, rejected, or, in the 
worst case, no response.”

    “I equate it to The Wizard of Oz,” Rob added. 
“Candidates often think of ATS as this AI-centric ‘entity 
behind the curtain’. It seems like some sort of 
all-powerful system that dictates whether prospects are 
considered for a job.”

Rob noted that the proper ATS is simply a solution 
recruiters use to comb over resumes for applicants who 
meet the hiring manager-defined criteria for a given 
role. (And often while listening to a “deep focus” 
playlist.)

That’s not to say AI can’t help in other ways (e.g., 
shortlisting prospects to evaluate, auto-archiving 
unqualified individuals, recommending candidates in your 
database to nurture).

It simply means artificial intelligence isn’t an ATS 
feature that can or should make important decisions 
regarding who talent teams should or shouldn’t move 
forward with.

2) Recruiters reach out to prospects in bulk without 
reviewing resumes

Another common applicant tracking system misconception 
revolves around talent outreach.

Some believe talent specialists use an ATS to simply send 
generic and generalized emails to prospects in bulk and 
don’t (or can’t) custom-tailor any of their candidate 
communications.

This technically may be true with legacy ATS that lack 
talent nurturing capabilities.

    However, that’s not the case with modern applicant 
tracking systems that understand the importance of 
offering automated and intelligent email nurturing 
capabilities for TA teams — the kind that leads to higher 
conversions and a better candidate experience.

LeverTRM™ users certainly have the option to send bulk 
emails to prospect “lists” (e.g., those who seem like 
good fits for open roles). But they personalize their 
emails to ensure candidates receive the most relevant, 
timely messaging.

In other words? They don’t spam their sourced talent with 
the same messaging regarding roles. Instead, each 
prospect gets bespoke emails pertaining solely to a 
specific position of interest.
3) Candidates can “trick” applicant tracking systems into 
accepting resumes

“Gaming the [applicant tracking] system” is another 
common myth among candidates.

Many job seekers work with resume writers and job coaches 
to fine-tune their profiles and portfolios. They do this 
in an attempt to ensure their applications get accepted 
by ATS solutions because they believe they have 
“auto-review” functionality that looks for key words or 
phrases recruiters and hiring managers are looking for.

Some ATS offer this AI functionality. But, again, the 
most successful hiring teams:

    1) Examine applications and resumes one by one after 
knockout questions automatically eliminate unqualified 
candidates from contention for roles
    2) Work closely with one another (i.e., ensure strong 
recruiter-hiring manager collaboration) to determine the 
right candidates to advance in the process

“For every role I manage, I have frequent communication 
with the hiring manager,” said Rob. “I aim to understand 
their needs and blockers. I also seek to share the vision 
they have for this hire. It’s with this framing that I 
review applicants.”

    Rob looks for “key indicators of alignment” when 
reviewing applicants’ resumes to ultimately address the 
needs of the business units he services.

“To that point, it’s very helpful to have a detailed 
resume,” said Rob. “Focus on the application of your 
experiences and how it relates to the opportunity you’re 
applying for.”

More specifically, Rob noted applicants can make their 
resumes stand out to recruiters with succinct yet 
detailed resumes that make it easy for recruiters to 
learn all important details associated with them 
(education, work experience, skills, and the like).

4) The sole goal of an applicant tracking system is to 
serve recruiters

Yes, an applicant tracking system is only used by (you 
guessed it) talent teams. But that doesn’t mean an ATS 
isn’t beneficial for candidates as well.

After all, leading ATS solutions have features intended 
to help recruiters and talent specialists provide a 
high-quality candidate experience to each prospect.

Just look at the talent acquisition strategy implemented 
by Lever customer TextNow:

    Upon joining the business, the company’s new talent 
leaders saw its TA org used LeverTRM as its primary ATS 
and CRM solution. But it became clear the team wasn’t 
using our complete talent acquisition suite to its 
fullest potential.
    Specifically, the talent leads saw many candidates 
its (high-priced) agency sourced for them were being 
largely ignored in Lever. In other words, the team wasn’t 
taking advantage of our CX-enhancing capabilities, like 
Lever Nurture.
    By training their staff on how to make the most of 
LeverTRM (thanks to past experience using it) and moving 
their sourcing in-house, the TextNow TA org transformed 
its approach to connecting with and converting top 
candidates.
    Just as importantly, the team ensured it could offer 
a world-class candidate experience to prospective hires 
in its talent pool and never let a prospect ‘slip through 
the cracks’ of its recruiting process ever again.

“We’ve built out a kick-ass recruiting coordinator 
function where we’re educating candidates, making sure 
they’re informed, keeping them engaged, and nurturing 
them throughout the process,” TextNow Manager of 
Recruiting Operations Austin Nelson noted.

“We do all of that through LeverTRM.”
5) An ATS is only something Fortune 500 companies need to 
succeed

A full-fledged applicant tracking system that helps their 
talent orgs improve communication and collaboration, 
streamline and automate many once-manual tasks, and 
enhance their core hiring metrics and KPIs is now table 
stakes for large-scale companies today.

But that doesn’t mean small and mid-sized businesses 
can’t benefit from an ATS either.

Even if your hiring ambitions are modest (i.e., looking 
to bring on just a few workers per month or quarter), 
that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t enable your talent team 
to source, nurture, interview, analyze, and rediscover 
talent more efficiently and effectively.

Just the opposite.

    A single-source-of-truth ATS with the above CRM 
capabilities (like LeverTRM) empowers your TA org — no 
matter the size — to tackle crucial tasks with ease and 
stay on the same page regarding candidate activity.

From writing job descriptions and setting up custom 
nurtures to analyzing data related to leads and aiding HR 
with their onboarding process, the right ATS-CRM gives 
talent teams at SMBs and enterprises alike greater 
control over and confidence in their recruiting efforts.

In the digital age of recruitment, the Applicant Tracking 
System (ATS) has become the backbone of the hiring 
process for companies large and small. Yet, despite its 
prevalence, the ATS is shrouded in myths and 
misconceptions that can leave job seekers feeling 
confused and even defeated. From tales of impenetrable 
resume filters to the idea of an AI boogeyman silently 
rejecting applications, the rumors are rampant. But what 
happens when we peel back the layers? What truths are 
revealed by those who actually wield these digital tools? 
Let's dive in, guided by insights from recruiters across 
various industries.
The ATS: A Digital Gatekeeper?

It's a common belief that the ATS is the gatekeeper, 
automatically rejecting resumes before they can even be 
glanced at by human eyes. This image of the ATS as an 
overzealous sentinel has haunted many a job seeker's 
dreams. However, this is one of the first myths that need 
busting. According to feedback from various different ATS 
users, this couldn't be further from the truth. Systems 
like Greenhouse, Bullhorn, and iCIMS, among others, do 
not auto-reject resumes or coldly discard your 
application based on a mysterious set of algorithms.
From Screening to Organizing Resumes: Understanding ATS 
Functions

So, if ATSs aren't the ruthless eliminators they've been 
made out to be, what are they doing with your resume? Key 
features of an ATS include managing job openings, 
handling applications, progressing candidates through 
various hiring stages, scheduling interviews and calls, 
logging interactions, and tracking follow-up 
communications. In essence, an ATS simplifies the 
recruitment workflow, enabling recruiters to efficiently 
manage and navigate through the plethora of applications 
they receive.

When recruiters speak about 'automation', they are 
typically referring to broader automations in the 
recruiting workflow (such as an automated email to a 
candidate when they are moved from “initial phone screen” 
to “hiring manager review”). An ATS also parses your 
resume and makes it easy to search resumes for certain 
keywords or experiences, such as “Java” or “Salesforce”. 

Finally, there are a few ATS who will highlight 
candidates based on their “fit” for a role (which is 
usually keywords, experience, etc. from their resume and 
comparing that to the job description). However, this 
doesn't translate to automated decision-making or 
auto-rejection. A resume ranked highly by an ATS is not 
the end-all; it simply means that based on the parameters 
set by the recruiters (which may include keywords, years 
of experience, education, etc.), the system has 
identified it as a strong match. The ultimate 
decision-making power still rests with the recruiters and 
hiring managers who interpret and act on that ranking.
Human Touch in a Digital World

Despite the technological assistance, recruitment remains 
a deeply human-centric process. The ATS is a tool—albeit 
a sophisticated one—that assists but doesn't replace the 
nuanced decision-making of a recruiter. These 
professionals still read through resumes, consider the 
context, and make calls based on a myriad of factors that 
no system could fully comprehend. Human intuition, 
experience, and judgment are irreplaceable assets in the 
hiring process, assets that no ATS can replicate or 
replace.
Myth vs. Reality: Key Takeaways for Job Seekers

For job seekers, this insight has significant 
implications. First and foremost, it's important to 
understand that while optimizing a resume for an ATS is 
wise, it should not be the sole focus of your application 
efforts. Crafting a resume that speaks to both machine 
and man is the key. Keywords and clear formatting will 
help with ranking, but it's the substance that will 
capture the attention of the human on the other end.

Moreover, the fear that one wrong word or a lack of 
specific jargon will result in automatic rejection should 
be alleviated. Yes, keywords matter, but they're part of 
a larger puzzle. Recruiters are looking for the overall 
fit, experience, skills, and potential contribution that 
a candidate can bring. It's a holistic view, not a binary 
decision dictated by keyword density.
The ATS Landscape: Diversity and Evolution

The ATS market is diverse, with systems ranging from 
Lever to Success Factors, each with its own set of 
features and methodologies. This variety ensures that 
there's no one-size-fits-all approach to how resumes are 
handled. Each company tailors its ATS to meet its unique 
hiring needs and company culture. As such, job seekers 
should stay informed about the different systems and 
remain adaptable in their application strategies.

As we look toward the future, it's also worth noting that 
ATS technology is constantly evolving. What holds true 
today may change tomorrow. But one constant remains: the 
human element in recruitment is going nowhere. As much as 
algorithms and automation can assist, they serve to 
augment the hiring process, not to commandeer it.
Conclusion: Embrace the ATS, Don't Fear It

In conclusion, it's time to demystify the ATS and reframe 
it from an adversary to an ally. By understanding the 
myths and realities of how these systems work, both 
recruiters and job seekers can navigate the hiring 
landscape more effectively. So, polish your resume with 
both the ATS and the recruiter in mind, but remember, at 
the end of the day, it's a pair of human eyes that will 
be reviewing your skills, experiences, and potential fit 
for their team. Let's put the myths to bed and approach 
the ATS as what it truly is—a tool that, when leveraged 
with understanding and skill, can lead to the door of 
your next great opportunity.
