Beep beep! Winning resume coming through.

Your resume is more than just a list of previous jobs and education. It's 
the story of you and your professional life. Scratch that. It's the story 
of you and your professional development.

Employers want to look at your resume and see that story loud and clear. 
Where have you been? What have you done? Most importantly, what have you 
accomplished? They don't only want to know what you think you have 
learned; they want to know how you benefited your previous employers.

One of the most efficient ways to do this is by applying the C.A.R. method 
when building your resume. C.A.R. is the acronym for Challenge, Action, 
and Results.

Read on to discover how to apply the C.A.R. method to your resume and get 
better results in your job search.
C: Challenge

Every position faces challenges. This doesn't mean dealing with a 
challenging co-worker, it's about the company and your role within it. 
What issues were you or the company facing that you were able to fix? It 
doesn't matter if you work in construction, payroll, or sales — all 
companies have their own sets of issues that they look to their employees 
to help solve.

For each job that you have listed on your resume, think about the tasks 
you were given. Each task is, in other words, a problem — something that 
hasn't been done that needs to be done. By doing the task, you'll be 
solving some issue for the company.

When brainstorming for ideas, it's not the day-to-day issues you're 
looking for, but the problems that required time, strategy, and skill to 
solve. Bring out those challenges on your resume. Here are some examples.

Instead of: Researched marketing strategies.

Try: Improved our company's return on investment with our marketing 
campaigns.

Instead of: Worked with frontend checkout process.

Try: Helped improve our sales-per-hour numbers at checkout.

Instead of: New market analysis.

Try: Found new markets for our products in the Midwest.

Of course the bigger the problem, the more impressive the resume. But when 
you're putting together your resume, don't worry about that. You don't 
want to make things sound bigger than they were. Just think about the real 
issues that were facing your company and your position and get them on 
your resume.
A: Action

Now you've established that you were in charge of handling a problem. What 
did you do about it? What strategy did you put in place to tackle the 
problem and why? Did you implement new policies? Did you cut wasteful 
spending?

The key to “Action” is keeping it short and sweet. You only have so much 
room on your resume, and of the three items in the C.A.R. formula, the 
action should get the least amount of attention. Be concise and simply 
state what you did to improve the situation. Here are some examples.

Shifted marketing dollars away from print and billboards to create a radio 
campaign integrated with social media.

Added a new coding system at checkout for looking up produce.

Researched applications for our products in schools and hospitals in the 
Midwest.

While this part of the equation may get the fewest words on your resume, 
you will need to be ready to explain it in further detail. If you get the 
interview, the hiring company will very likely want to know why you chose 
that specific strategy.

R: Results

This is what prospective employers really want to see. Sure, you were 
faced with a problem and came up with a plan to address it, but how did 
you do? They don't want to hear that it “went well.” They want to see 
quantifiable results. Here are some examples.

Improved ROI on marketing by 35% in the first year.

Increased sales-per-hour from 23 to 38 due to faster produce lookup times.

Grew sales to the Midwest by 78% by developing a new market with public 
school systems.

Top tip: Really frontload the important information on these statements. 
Don't hide the payoff at the end. Recruiters only scan resumes for an 
average of six seconds before making a judgment, so what they do see needs 
to be the most impactful material you have.

The statements like these in a C.A.R. resume show that you don't just show 
up to work each day — you get things done that help the company. When 
faced with a challenge, you're not afraid to dig in and create a solution.

But what if your solution didn't get great results or maybe didn't work at 
all? That's tough to put out there on your resume, but if it's relevant 
work experience, you should do so anyway. If possible, try to spin the 
results phrase into a positive (i.e. what you learned from it). For 
example:

ROI on radio campaign was negligible because the social media campaign did 
not properly support it. New procedures were developed to streamline and 
sync campaigns.

It's okay to admit that a project didn't go as planned. Do you think 
employers really believe that every applicant has a flawless work history? 
Seeing an admission of error and a secondary solution shows integrity. A 
prospective employer who isn't able to recognize that is likely going to 
be a challenge to work for anyway.
The C.A.R. resume

When done properly, a C.A.R. resume is easy and quick to scan, but still 
paints a great picture of the candidate and what they truly bring to the 
table. Every job exists to help make the company better in one way or 
another. From keeping floors and bathrooms clean to improving networking 
solutions between cities, each person in the workforce is tasked with 
making their company better.

A C.A.R. method resume shines a spotlight on the contributions you've made 
to each of the companies you've worked for. Ideally, each progressive job 
should show bigger and more productive solutions.

Want even more incentive to boost your resume with the C.A.R. technique? 
Think about the interviews you've had in the past. There are usually some 
awkward moments when you're not sure how to talk about what you actually 
did at a certain job. While building your C.A.R. resume, you'll be forced 
to really examine your career stops and what you accomplished while you 
were there.

When it comes time to sit down face-to-face for that interview, you'll be 
ready for just about any question they can throw at you. You'll know your 
strengths, weaknesses, and most likely which projects meant the most to 
you and why.

Every job has a challenge. A good employee will take action to fight that 
problem. A great employee can talk about the amazing results they achieved 
with their actions. You've been that great employee, so make sure your 
resume tells that story.

What is a challenge action result resume?
A challenge action result resume is a resume writing process that can help 
you discover and convey the key facts of your experience in a professional 
and succinct manner to make it memorable. CAR statements may present your 
experience, skills and qualifications in a way that succinctly 
demonstrates these abilities via different activities and projects 
completed in past roles. Using the CAR technique requires you to deviate 
from the standard resume and its list of work titles and duties.Related:

How to use the challenge action result method for your resume
Here are the three steps you can take to use this method for your resume:
1. Highlight the challenge
To write the challenges effectively, it's important to consider the 
challenges that the company may have been facing in each of your previous 
roles. Whether you work in construction, payroll, or sales, each company 
has its own set of challenges that it expects employees to address. 
Consider the responsibilities they assigned you for each position and 
think of each as a problem that still needs addressing. By completing the 
task, you resolved a problem for the company. Try to focus on problems 
that required strategy and skill to solve.Related: What Is the Standard 
Canadian Resume Format? (With 7 Tips)
2. Provide the actions performed
Next, discuss the actions you performed, the methods you used to address 
the problem, and why you used them. You may also discuss if you've 
implemented new policies and reduced wasteful spending. Try to write this 
section succinctly, be clear, and explain simply what you did to remedy 
the problem. Here are a few examples:

    Directed marketing spending to a social media-integrated radio 
campaign
    Added a new tagging system for searching products at checkout
    Researched uses for our goods in schools and hospitals

3. Discuss the results
Try to include measurable outcomes from the challenge you encountered and 
the solutions you provided. Place the most significant information at the 
beginning of these statements. Many recruiters examine resumes for a short 
time, so try to ensure the information they view is your most interesting 
and impressive content. Here are a few examples:

    Increased marketing's return on investment by 45% in the first year
    Due to improved product search times, sales per hour increased from 
23% to 38% of traffic
    Developed a new market with public school systems to increase sales by 
67%
