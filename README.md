# Poptart AI - Your Sassy Resume Assistant 🐱💼  

Welcome to Poptart AI, the AI-powered resume writing assistant with personality! Named after my spoiled, pate-loving cat, Poptart AI helps you craft compelling resumes with expert AI guidance—while keeping things delightfully snarky. Built with Django and the OpenAI API, and hosted on AWS, it's available online in its early stages at http://poptart-ai.bridgetbangert.com/.

As a graduate student working full-time, job hunting became a significant time commitment. Tailoring my resume for each application is crucial to stand out, but it’s also mentally-fatiguing and time-consuming. With everyone leveraging AI for resume curation, I realized there was a gap in the market for a specialized app that could streamline the process. That’s why I created PoptartAI – to save myself time and energy while job hunting, and to make the process of tailoring resumes faster and more efficient (currently in the early stages of development).
